/*
 * Goal: Put googly eyes on a face!
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Find an image on the Internet and drop it into the /images folder at the
 *    top level of this module. It can be anything as long as it has large eyes!
 * 
 * 2. Declare a variable for the image:
 *    PImage face;
 * 	  	
 * 3. In your setup() method, import your image using the following code:
 *    face = loadImage("face.jpg");
 * 	
 * 4. Resize your face image to the size of the window using the resize() method.
 * 
 * 5. In the draw() method, place a white ellipse over the left eye of your image.
      HINT: To find out where to put it, add code to print the mouseX and
      mouseY where you click the mouse.
 *
 * 6. Now add a pupil (the black part) to the left eye.
 * 
 * 7. Use mouseX and mouseY to move the left pupil where the mouse moves.
 * 
 * 8. Repeat the same steps for the right eye.
 * 
 * 9. Add a right pupil and make it move by using
 *    mouseX + [distance from left eye] and mouseY + [distance from left eye].
 * 
 * 10.Hereâ€™s the tricky part: stop the pupils from going outside of the white
 *    circles! To do this, imagine a rectangle that the pupil should stay
 *    within. When mouseX and mouseY goes outside of these bounds, set it back
 *    to the boundary. Put this code before you draw the pupils.
